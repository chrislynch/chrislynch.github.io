## Long Biography

### The Day Job

I’m currently the IT Director of Source Insurance. Prior to this I was the founder and CTO of Cardiff based digital agency Gravit-e for almost ten years and spent eight years before that working for the National Health Service on a wide range of software projects. I am also a founder director at TruTech and ReturnApp.

My book on digital marketing and search engine optimisation, “The Truth About SEO“, has been a number one download on Amazon across multiple categories. I’m a strong advocate of open source technologies and share software and open-source advice on my personal technology website.

### Books and Comics

I also write books for children and adults, most recently working on Doctor Who spin-off books in the extended Haisman universe for Candy Jar Publishing. Over the past few years, I have written a number of books, novellas, and short stories for Candy Jar and always have more in the pipeline. My children’s book, “Curse of the Mirror Clowns“, was shortlisted for a Scribe Award in 2019.

When I’m not writing books I create comics as one-half of the comic book studio Monkeys with Machineguns. As well as self-publishing our own comics, we have worked with a range of comic book publishers in the UK and US including The Judge Dredd Megazine, Arcana, Metaverse, The Psychedelic Journal of Time Travel, 2026 Books, Accent UK, Something Wicked, The Sorrow, The Mad Scientist Journal, KZine, Wilde Times, Another Realm, 10thology, Midnight Hour, and Insomnia Publications.

### TV/Film and Radio

I am co-writer/producer at Welsh independent film studio The Black Room. Our short “The Black Room” has been featured on Amazon Prime Video and our first feature film, OffWorld, is currently in post-production ahead of a world-wide release with a major distributor.

More or less once a week, you’ll hear me on South Wales ONE (formerly ACJ Radio) on the Soundclash. This show is syndicated worldwide with an audience as far away as Australia!

### Other Stuff

If I’m not working I’m probably cooking, messing about with hypnotism, helping out at Cardiff 61st Scout Group, or just making a general nuisance of myself.
